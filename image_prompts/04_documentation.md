```
**STYLE PRESET (MAINTAIN STRICT VISUAL CONSISTENCY)**
A vertical mind-map diagram visualizing the TooltipCard API structure. The core "TooltipCard" node sits at the top center, with cascading glass panes flowing downwards representing properties like "Appearance", "Beak", "Positioning", and "Behavior".

Design elements:
- Deep Purple background with a faint circuit-board pattern
- Nodes are frosted glass cards connected by glowing neon lines
- "Appearance" branch glows Cyan, "Beak" branch glows Magenta, etc.
- 3D perspective looking slightly upwards at the tree
- High-contrast text for readability
- Floating version badge "v2.5"

Style: Technical visualization, 3D Node Tree
Mood: Organized, Structural, High-tech

## 4:5 - Quick Start Vertical

```
**STYLE PRESET (MAINTAIN STRICT VISUAL CONSISTENCY)**
A vertical step-by-step installation guide. Four distinct 3D glass sections float vertically, connected by a central "timeline" light beam.

Step layout:
1. INSTALL - Terminal window graphic with `flutter pub add tooltip_card`
2. IMPORT - Document icon with code lines
3. WRAP - Widget tree icon showing the wrapping logic
4. CUSTOMIZE - Palette icon with a mini tooltip preview

Design elements:
- Dark mode aesthetic
- Each step icon is a 3D floaty element
- The central beam pulses with light
- "Get Started" header in large, modern typography
- Progress indicators (checkmarks) glowing green

Style: Onboarding Flow, Vertical Timeline
Mood: Simple, Fast, Efficient

## 4:5 - Theming Code Showcase

```
**STYLE PRESET (MAINTAIN STRICT VISUAL CONSISTENCY)**
A vertical split composition focused on code configuration. The top half features a sleek, dark-mode code editor window showing `TooltipCardThemeData`. The bottom half shows the *result* of that code: a set of beautiful, custom-themed tooltips.

Composition:
- Top: IDE window (VS Code style) with syntax highlighting (neon purple/blue tokens)
- Bottom: 3D render of the resulting tooltips (Dark, Light, Custom) floating
- A glowing arrow connects the code to the preview

Design elements:
- Glassmorphism window chrome for the editor
- "Live Reload" conceptual visual link
- Deep indigo background
- "Theme It Your Way" banner text

Style: Developer Experience (DX), Code-to-Visual
Mood: Powerful, Flexible, Developer-centric

## 4:5 - Positioning Matrix

```
**STYLE PRESET (MAINTAIN STRICT VISUAL CONSISTENCY)**
A dense, high-information vertical grid reference card. It displays the 12 placement options in a clean, dark-mode grid, acting as a quick cheat sheet for developers.

Layout:
- 4x3 Grid of mini-modules
- Each module shows a central "anchor" dot and a tooltip in the relative position
- Placement names (e.g., "topStart") are crisp and legible
- Active positions are highlighted in Neon Cyan

Design elements:
- Tech-dark aesthetic (Slate/Charcoal background)
- Subtle glowing outlines for the grid cells
- "Compass" or "Target" iconography in the background
- Printable reference quality (sharp lines)
- "Positioning Masterclass" header

Style: Cheat Sheet, Reference Grid, Clean
Mood: Educational, Handy, Precise
