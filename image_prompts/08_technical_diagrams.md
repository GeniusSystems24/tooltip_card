## 4:5 - Vertical Widget Tree

```
**STYLE PRESET (MAINTAIN STRICT VISUAL CONSISTENCY)**
A vertical hierarchy diagram visualizing the TooltipCard widget structure in 3D space. The tree grows from top to bottom.

Nodes:
- Top: MaterialApp (Glass Sphere)
- Mid: Scaffold (Glass Cube)
- Hero: TooltipCard (Glowing Pyramid/Prism) highlighting its injection point

Design elements:
- Deep Indigo background
- Connection lines are fiber-optic cables (glowing)
- "Overlay Layer" shown as a ghost plane hovering in front of the main tree
- High-tech, microscopic detail level

Style: Architecture Viz, Sci-Fi Data
Mood: Complex yet Organized, Structural

## 4:5 - Positioning Logic Vertical

```
**STYLE PRESET (MAINTAIN STRICT VISUAL CONSISTENCY)**
A vertical three-step logic flow visualizing the "Smart Positioning" algorithm.

Steps (Top Down):
1. SCAN: A radar-like scan effect checking screen boundaries
2. COMPUTE: A glowing geometric core calculating the best angle
3. PLACE: The final tooltip snapping into position with a green "Success" glow

Design elements:
- Cyberpunk/Matrix data rainfall aesthetics (subtle)
- Mathematical angles and distance lines shown in gold
- "Algorithm in Action" vertical text

Style: Algorithm Viz, Process Flow
Mood: Intelligent, Fast, Automated

## 4:5 - Event Loop Flowchart

```
**STYLE PRESET (MAINTAIN STRICT VISUAL CONSISTENCY)**
A vertical circuit-board flowchart showing the lifecycle of a tooltip.

Path:
- Input (Tap/Hover) -> Timer (Delay) -> Bloom (Fade In) -> Wait -> Fade Out

Design elements:
- Dark background with neon path tracing
- Each stage in the lifecycle is a micro-chip node
- Active path is lit up in bright Cyan
- "State Machine" aesthetic with binary code texture

Style: Technical Flow, Logic Circuit
Mood: Logical, Electrical, Precise

## 4:5 - Anatomy Exploded View

```
**STYLE PRESET (MAINTAIN STRICT VISUAL CONSISTENCY)**
A vertical exploded view of the tooltip layers, separated along the Z-axis.

Layers (Top to Bottom):
1. Content (Text/Icon widgets)
2. Shape/Path (The tooltip body with beak)
3. Background/Blur (The glass material)
4. Shadow (The ambient occlusion plane)

Design elements:
- Isometric perspective
- Dotted lines connecting the corners of each layer
- Labels floating off to the side (e.g., "Glass Shader", "Beak Path")
- High-end product rendering quality

Style: Exploded Diagram, Component Anatomy
Mood: Deep, Educational, Detailed
