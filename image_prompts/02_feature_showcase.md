## 4:5 - Smart Positioning System

```
**STYLE PRESET (MAINTAIN STRICT VISUAL CONSISTENCY)**
A precise 4:5 vertical technical visualization of the smart positioning system.

The vertical layout emphasizes the "Start" and "End" placements beautifully.

Design elements:
- Deep Purple/Indigo gradient background with a faint, high-tech grid overlay
- Central anchor element is a glowing, interactive button
- 12 ghost tooltips (translucent wireframes) arranged radially
- Active tooltip (Top-Center) is fully rendered in glass
- Color-coded connection lines (cyan/magenta) indicating the logic
- Floating labels: "Smart Overflow Detection"
- Cinematic lighting highlighting the active position

Color palette: Deep purple (#7C3AED), Indigo (#4F46E5), Cyan/Magenta accents

## 4:5 - Trigger Modes Vertical

```
**STYLE PRESET (MAINTAIN STRICT VISUAL CONSISTENCY)**
A vertical card stack animation capturing the 5 trigger modes. The composition features a stack of five 3D cards/plates floating vertically, each representing a mode (Hover, Press, Long Press, etc.), with the active mode glowing.

Layout (top to bottom):
1. HOVER - Cursor hovering over a glass card
2. PRESS - A finger tap visual ripple effect
3. LONG PRESS - A circular progress loader around a tap
4. RIGHT CLICK - A mini context menu graphic
5. PROGRAMMATIC - A "Code" bracket symbol glowing

Design elements:
- Rich Deep Purple background with ambient occlusion shadows
- Each mode plate has a frosted glass finish
- Neon icons floating above each plate
- Subtle motion blur suggesting a vertical scroll
- "Multi-Modal Interaction" vertical text running up the side

Color palette: Dark background, Neon accents (Blue, Green, Orange, Purple, Teal)
Style: Modern UI showcase, Feature stack

## 4:5 - Modal Barrier Effect

```
**STYLE PRESET (MAINTAIN STRICT VISUAL CONSISTENCY)**
A split-screen vertical comparison highlighting the "Modal Barrier" feature. The image is divided diagonally. The top half shows the UI in "Standard" mode, while the bottom half demonstrates the "Barrier" mode with a beautiful, cinematic blur dimming everything except the tooltip.

Composition:
- Top Left (Standard): Sharp, clear UI background with a standard tooltip.
- Bottom Right (Barrier): A rich gaussian blur applied to the background, with the tooltip glowing brightly in focus.
- A "Focus Beam" light effect separates the two zones.

Design elements:
- High-fidelity mobile UI mockup as the base
- The blurred section uses a "frosted glass" aesthetic
- The focal tooltip pops with increased brightness and shadow depth
- Floating text: "Focus Mode" in clean, modern typography
- Particle effects emphasizing the focused area

- Soft spotlights illuminate each item from above
- Minimalist labels floating below each variant ("Rounded", "Sharp", "None")
- Deep, rich background to make the glass pop
- "Infinite Customization" subtitle at the bottom

Style: Component gallery, 3D Exhibit
Mood: Customizable, Elegant, Detailed
